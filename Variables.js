// A variable is a “named storage” for data. We can use variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data.

// To create a variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword.

// The statement below creates (in other words: declares) a variable with the name “message”:

let message;
// initially, to declare a variable in javascript, you would used the var keyward. But that is no more used because of some reasons which you will get to know later.

//Now we can put some information into it by using the assignment '=' operator

message = "ALEX THE JAVASCRIPT CODER";

//We can declare multiple variables in one line like:

//  let name = 'alex', user ='admin', age = 22;

//But the prefered way is to put them on seperarte lines like:
let name = "alex";
let user = "admin";
let age = 22;
